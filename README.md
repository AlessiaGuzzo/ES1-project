## General Information
This is our work for the project of Embedded Systems course of the 2020-2021 academic year.
We wanted to explore the possible alternatives in loading the instructions to be executed by the _Cortex-M3 processor_.
For doing this we have analysed as instruction memories the ITCM, the BRAM and a fake memory made by us that communicates directly with the processor according to the AXI protocol. The comparison consists in observing the differences in execution times of the same firmware, executed by the three different instruction memories.


## Tools
We have used Vivado and in particular have written the files in _SystemVerilog_.
